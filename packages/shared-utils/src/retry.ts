/**
 * Shared retry with exponential backoff and jitter.
 *
 * Several services in this repo call external systems — IPFS pinning nodes,
 * Soroban RPC endpoints, S3 — and each grew its own attempt loop. The loops
 * disagreed on how many attempts to make, whether to cap the delay, and whether
 * the operation was safe to replay, which is exactly the kind of divergence that
 * turns a transient blip into an outage.
 *
 * `withRetry` is the single implementation, built around the one question that
 * actually decides whether a retry is safe: **is this failure transient?**
 *
 * Replaying a request is not free of consequences. A POST that timed out after
 * the server accepted it must not be replayed blindly, or the caller pays twice.
 * Callers therefore pass `isRetryable`, and anything not explicitly deemed
 * transient fails on the first attempt.
